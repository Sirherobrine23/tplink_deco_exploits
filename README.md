### Purpose
- bypass firmware signature check that prevents some tplink deco devices from accepting user-provided firmware

### Devices
according to tplink, uboot http "webfailsafe" recovery is present on the following:
- Deco E4
- Deco M4
- Deco P9
- Deco M9 Plus
- Deco X20/X60 V1 (firmware 1.2.5 or later version)
- Deco X20 V1.2 and later version
- Deco X60 V2 and later
- Deco S4
But these devices come in different "versions" which may have completely different hardware and uboot

### Known working with static version
- Deco S4 v2
- Deco M4R v1/v2

### Known working with dynamic version
- Deco S4 v2
- Deco M4R v1
- Expecting others should work also, feedback appreciated
